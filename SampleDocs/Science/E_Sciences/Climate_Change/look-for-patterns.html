<h2>How can I look for patterns?</h2>

Graphs are wonderful for noticing patterns – much better than a list of numbers!
<ul>
    <li>When you want to compare two variables, make a new graph with one variable on each axis.
    </li>
    <li>Focus on the shape of the graph first. How would you describe the relationship in words? Are there any points
        that seem out of place?
    </li>
    <li>Do more runs to fill in gaps and add extreme values.
    </li>
    <li>See if the results are variable or erratic by comparing two identical runs.
    </li>
    <li>Connect points using the ruler menu.
    </li>
    <li>Compare the shape to a movable line using the ruler menu.

</ul>
