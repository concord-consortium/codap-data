<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>This is a simulation model of Climate Changes. When you start the model, it runs for 70 years and then stops. You can
    run the model in "slow motion" to see what's going on, or "fast" to quickly collect data.</p>

<p><b>Your task is to discover how one of the many variables that affect Earth’s climate could change the global
    temperature 70 years from today (Year 2084). See how a change in the Earth's Climate variable that you chose affects
    the global atmospheric temperature.</b>
<ol>
    <li>CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (CO2 molecules)</li>
    <li>Sun's brightness (the number of yellow sunrays)</li>
    <li>Albedo which is the reflectivity of Earth's surface (color of the horizontal surface)</li>
    <li>Number of clouds in the atmosphere</li>
</ol>

<p>The small graph will show two temperature lines: one for yearly temperature and the other for 10 year average
    temperature. In the model you will also see heat packets representing heat energy in the earth and heat radiation
    given off by the earth's surface.</p>

<p>Alter the variables to see how they will affect the 10 year average temperature. Click the "Analyze Data" button and
    as you alter a variable watch how it populates in the table.<img class="icon"
                                                                     src="../Common/images/tables_icon.png"></p>
<p>Once you have altered each of the variables, plot some new variables into a graph <img class="icon"
                                                                                          src="../Common/images/graph_icon.png">
    and see what you notice. Drag two variables from the table into your graph. You can drag a third variable into the
    middle of the graph to create a legend. What did you discover?</p>
