<h2>How can I look at only part of my data?</h2>
<P>By default, all the data shows up on a graph. Often you want to look at one run or
a set of runs for which only one variable is changing.  There are several ways to do this:</P>
<ul>
<li>Select the runs from the table by highlighting the rows (click and drag).
Those rows that are highlighted in the table will also be highlighted in the graph. <br/>
</li>
<li>Drag across the graph points you want highlighted.
</li>
<li>Choose a single run from the row of numbers at the top of the graph.
</li>
<li>Use the <b>Hide and Show</b> function in the eye menu on the graph.

</li>
<li>Color the datasets by attribute. Drag an attribute into the center of the graph
(making a legend) and choose <b>Treat as categorical</b>.
